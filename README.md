## Travel Agency App

## Technolgies used
1. Vue.js
2. Scss
3. Vite

## Requirements
-- Build a given view of a mobile web application using SASS/SCSS that consumes an API endpoint for the data on the page.

## How to setup

Run the following commands to setup, given `node` and `npm` is available:

1. git clone git@github.com:Nathan-s-Anthony/Travel-Agency-App.git
1. cd travelagencyapp
1. npm install
1. npm run dev -> to see a output

## What i learnt
1. Vue.js. This is my first project working with this framework and i thoroughly enjoyed working with this amazing framework , i still have lots to learn about it but it was a great project to get started on with this framework.
2.Working with API's. This is also my time working with API's and integrating them into an application, i really enjoyed the ease of using axios to make the api request and populating the components with the data. 
3. More understanding of css to make more advanced layouts.

## Improvements that i would make
1. Making more use of mixin functions to allow for more maintainability of the scss codebase 

##  Challenges that i faced 
1. Consuming the API Endpoint without the cors error.
2  Creating a functional slider.


## Features that i would include in a future update
1. Fully functional slider
2. Side Navigation menu with the respected navigation items
3. Functional search option and notification area
4. Functional Footer menu that provides navigation across the application
